    <P>                       Long ago, there lived three handsome young men in a certain village. They loved one another by heart. They were very good friends. They have faith on one another. Once they were going on a pilgrimage. There was a thick forest on the way. It was the month of June. The sun was shining brightly in the sky. It was very hot.

        They stopped under a shady tree to have a rest. They laydown on the ground to relax for some time. By chance one of them caught sight of a bag tied to a branch of the tree. He climbed up to the bag, united it, and brought it down. In that bag there was another bag which was full of gold coins. They became very happy to see the gold coins.
        
        They decided to dive the gold coins equally among themselves. Two of them started counting the coins. Just then the third friend said, “Friends, I am very hungry. I want food first.”
        
        As they were all hungry, they decided to buy food from a nearby village.
        
        One of them left for the village. On the way he was caught by the greed. He thought of keeping all the gold coins for himself. He soon reached the village. First of all he ate food to his fill. Then he bought food for his friends, poisoned it, and happily left for the forest. He planned to kill his friends.
        
        Meanwhile, his friends has decided to kill him and divide the gold coins equally between themselves. When he came with the food, they fell upon him and killed him. They were hungry so they enjoyed the food their friend has brought for them from the village. They did not know that it had been poisoned by their friend. Soon they died.
        
        Dear children, all the three friends died a tragic death only because they had become greedy. It is rightly said that greed is a curse. We should not be greedy. We should not take the things of other people. The result of bad deeds is always bad.
